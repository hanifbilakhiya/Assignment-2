            <h2>Ananthapura Lake temple</h2>
            <p> Ananthapura Lake Temple is a serene Hindu temple built in the middle of a lake located in Village
                Ananthapura, Kasargod. It is a holy temple of Ananthapadmanabhan Swami. It is believed that
                Ananthapadmanabhan settled down here first and then moved to Thiruvananthapuram through a cave which
                lies to the right-hand side corner of the lake. The cave is said to be a natural structure that
                separates Ananthapura and Thiruvananthapuram and therefore, these two temples retain the name of the
                same deity.</p>
            <p> The Ananthapura Lake Temple is a perfect example of nature living in total harmony with each other, and
                it indeed is, as it is seen by the presence of a crocodile in spite of humans visiting the temple to
                offer their prayers. Babiya never attacks the humans even when they use the tank for taking a bath and
                humans never treat him differently and together they maintain a blended and peaceful existence. One has
                to visit this temple to experience total harmony.</p>
