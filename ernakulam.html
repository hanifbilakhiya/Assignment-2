                March. Best Time To Visit: Throughout the year Ideal Duration: 1 Day Location: Kothamangalam-Pooyamkutty

            <h2>Santa Cruz Basilica</h2>
            <p>A vacation to Kerala is incomplete without spending some relaxing time in the fantastic backwaters of
                Alleppey. You can sit back and relax as you enjoy the magnificent setting of beautiful coconut fringed
                waters, paddy fields and lovely sights of the human-made islands. A houseboat experience is truly the
                best of both worlds as you enjoy the luxury style treatment of comfortable interiors and delicious food
                to make your experience memorable and worthwhile.</p>
            <p> The history of Santa Cruz Cathedral Basilica begins with the arrival of Portuguese missionaries along
                with the second Portuguese fleet under Pedro Álvares Cabral on 24 December 1500. The King Unni Goda
                Varma Tirumulpadu (Trimumpara Raja ) of Kingdom of Cochin received them very warmly. This caused the
                Zamorin of Calicut to declare war against Kingdom of Cochin. But the Portuguese army under Commander Dom
                Afonso de Albuquerque who reached Cochin in 1503, defeated the enemies of the King of Cochin and in
                return he gave them permission to build a fort in Kochi.</p>
